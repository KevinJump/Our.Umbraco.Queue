# The Queue for Umbraco 

A background processing queue - that lets you send stuff off into the 
background to get done while you don't have to think about (or babysit) it.

### Send to Queue
Quickly send content to the queue to be published in the backgoround

### Super flexible custom actions
Write your own custom queue actions, fire things into the queue and 
get your custom code to run when they reach the top.
